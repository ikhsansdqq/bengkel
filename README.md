# PROJECT BENGKEL

This project is a group assignment for a data structure course. It consists of four members. 
We designed the project to be like a workshop where vehicles are repaired by mechanics and attended to by customers.

### CONCEPT
![bengkel concept](https://github.com/ikhsansdqq/bengkel/blob/master/asset/image_asset_conceptual.jpg)

As shown in the above image, we have customers, cars, engines, and bodies. It is a direct implementation of a multilinked list.
